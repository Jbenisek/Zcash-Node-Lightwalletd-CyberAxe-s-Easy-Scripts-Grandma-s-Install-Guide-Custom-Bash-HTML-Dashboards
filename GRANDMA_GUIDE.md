## 🛑 HOW TO END IF THERE'S AN ISSUE

### If Installation Stops with an Error

**Something like this appears:**
```
[✗] ERROR: Something went wrong
```

**What to do:**

1. **Read the error message** - it usually tells you what's wrong
2. **Take a screenshot** - helpful for troubleshooting
3. **Don't panic** - all errors are fixable
4. **Common solutions:**

   - **"Permission denied"** 
     - Make sure you ran with `sudo`
     - Try again with: `sudo bash ./zecnode-cleanup.sh`
   
   - **"Network error" or "curl failed"**
     - Check your internet connection
     - Wait a minute and try again
   
   - **"Disk space error"**
     - You might not have enough free space
     - Free up at least 500GB before starting again
   
   - **"Not enough free space on /var/lib/zecnode"**
     - Restart from the beginning and pick a different drive with more space

5. **To restart the installation:**
   ```bash
   sudo bash ./zecnode-cleanup.sh
   ```

### If You Want to Stop It While It's Running

Press **Ctrl + C** on your keyboard. This will stop the current script.

To resume from the beginning:
```bash
sudo bash ./zecnode-cleanup.sh
```

---

## ✅ WHAT TO DO WHEN IT'S DONE

### Immediately After Installation Completes

1. **Leave your computer on**
   - The blockchain sync takes 3-7 days
   - It runs automatically in the background

2. **Monitor your node with the beautiful dashboard**
   - Open a new terminal and type:
   ```bash
   sudo bash ~/zebra-monitor.sh
   ```
   - This shows a beautiful Zcash dashboard with:
     - 🔷 Progress bar (how much syncing is done)
     - 📊 CPU and RAM usage
     - 🌐 Network peers connected
     - ⏱️ Estimated time remaining
   - **Keep this terminal open** - it proves your node is running!
   - It updates every 30 seconds automatically
   - Press **Ctrl+C** to stop monitoring

3. **Alternative: Quick status check**
   - If you just want a quick peek, type: `zebrad tip-height`
   - You should see a number like: `1234567`
   - This is the current block height
   - Run it again in a few minutes - it should be a higher number

### During the Next 3-7 Days

**Day 1-3: Fast sync**
- Height grows quickly
- Monitor shows: 0% → 10% → 25%
- Your computer may use 40-60% CPU (that's normal!)

**Day 3-7: Steady sync**
- Height grows steadily  
- Monitor shows: 25% → 50% → 75% → 100%
- CPU usage drops to 15-30%

### What the Monitor Dashboard Shows

```
╔═══ SERVICE STATUS ═══╗
║ Status: ✓ RUNNING
║ Block Height: 1234567
╚═══════════════════════╝

╔═══ BLOCKCHAIN SYNC ═══╗
║ Progress: [████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 45%
║ Sync: 45.2% | ≈ 24h remaining
╚═══════════════════════╝

╔═══ NETWORK ═══════════════╗
║ Peers Connected: 8
║ CPU Usage: 42.3%
║ RAM Usage: 1024MB
║ Disk Used: 125G
╚═════════════════════════════╝
```

**What each line means:**
- **Status:** ✓ RUNNING = everything is working
- **Block Height:** The current progress (goes up over time)
- **Progress Bar:** Visual representation (fills up to 100%)
- **Sync %:** Exact percentage done
- **Time Remaining:** Rough estimate of hours left
- **Peers:** Other computers helping you (4+ is good)
- **CPU/RAM:** System resources (your computer is working)
- **Disk Used:** How much space the blockchain is taking

### When Sync Is Complete (100%)

Once the progress bar reaches **100%** or the monitor says **✓ Fully Synchronized**:

- Your node is fully synced! 🎉
- The dashboard changes to show "NODE HEALTH" instead of "BLOCKCHAIN SYNC"
- It's now ready to receive transactions
- **Keep the monitor running** - it shows your node is alive and healthy

## 🔄 HOW TO RESTART IT

### After Your Computer Reboots

**Good news:** The Zcash node automatically restarts!

You don't need to do anything. It starts automatically and continues syncing from where it left off.

### To Manually Restart the Node

If you need to restart it for any reason:

**Restart just the Zcash node:**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart zebrad
```

**Option 2: Restart the wallet server**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart lightwalletd
```

**Option 3: Restart the web server**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart caddy
```

**Option 4: Restart all three**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart zebrad lightwalletd caddy
```

---

## ⏹️ HOW TO STOP IT

### To Temporarily Stop the Node

**Stop just Zebra:**
```bash
sudo systemctl stop zebrad
```

**Stop just lightwalletd:**
```bash
sudo systemctl stop lightwalletd
```

**Stop Caddy (web server):**
```bash
sudo systemctl stop caddy
```

**Stop everything:**
```bash
sudo systemctl stop zebrad lightwalletd caddy
```

### To Stop It From Auto-Starting on Reboot

```bash
sudo systemctl disable zebrad
sudo systemctl disable lightwalletd
sudo systemctl disable caddy
```

### To Re-Enable Auto-Start

```bash
sudo systemctl enable zebrad
sudo systemctl enable lightwalletd
sudo systemctl enable caddy
```

---

## 📊 HOW TO MONITOR IT

### Quick Status Check

**See current block height:**
```bash
zebrad tip-height --network Mainnet
```

You'll see a number like:
```
1234567
```

**See if all services are running:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status zebrad lightwalletd caddy
```

You should see `active (running)` for each one. If `lightwalletd` says "not found", see the troubleshooting section below.

### Live Monitoring (Updates Every 5 Seconds)

**Watch current block height update:**
```bash
watch -n 5 'zebrad tip-height --network Mainnet'
```

Press **Ctrl + C** to stop watching.

### View Detailed Logs

**See Zebra node logs:**
```bash
sudo journalctl -u zebrad -n 50
```
This shows the last 50 lines of activity.

**Follow Zebra logs live:**
```bash
sudo journalctl -u zebrad -f
```
This shows new messages as they happen. Press **Ctrl + C** to stop.![alt text](image.png)

**See lightwalletd logs:**
```bash
sudo journalctl -u lightwalletd -n 51
```

**See Caddy logs:**
```bash
sudo journalctl -u caddy -n 50
```

### Check Disk Usage

**See how much space blockchain is using:**
```bash
du -sh /var/lib/zecnode/zebra/
```

Example output: `45G` (45 gigabytes)

**See total free space:**
```bash
df -h /var/lib/zecnode/
```

### Dashboard Command (All-in-One)

```bash
echo "=== ZEBRA BLOCK HEIGHT ===" && zebrad tip-height && echo && echo "=== SERVICES ===" && sudo systemctl status zebrad caddy --no-pager | grep -E "Active|zebrad|caddy"
```

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Node isn't syncing?

1. Check if Zebra is running:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status zebrad
   ```

2. If it says `inactive`, restart it:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart zebrad
   ```

3. Check the current block height:
   ```bash
   zebrad tip-height
   ```
   
4. Wait a few minutes and run it again. If the number went up, it's syncing.

### Running out of disk space?

1. Check current usage:
   ```bash
   du -sh /var/lib/zecnode/zebra/
   ```

2. If you're running low, you might need to:
   - Wait for sync to complete (space usage stabilizes)
   - Free up space on the drive
   - Use a different larger drive

### Website says "connection refused"?

1. Check if Caddy is running:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status caddy
   ```

2. If it's not running, start it:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart caddy
   ```

3. Wait a few seconds and try accessing your domain again

### Services won't start?

1. Try restarting them:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart zebrad lightwalletd caddy
   ```

2. Check for disk space issues:
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

3. Check logs for specific errors:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u zebrad -n 50
   sudo journalctl -u lightwalletd -n 50
   sudo journalctl -u caddy -n 50
   ```

### lightwalletd service says "not found"?

This means Script 7 didn't complete successfully. Here's how to diagnose:

1. **Check if lightwalletd binary was built:**
   ```bash
   ls -lh /usr/local/bin/lightwalletd
   ```
   
   If you see the file, the binary exists. If not, Script 7 failed during build.

2. **Check if the service file exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -l /etc/systemd/system/lightwalletd.service
   ```
   
   If it says "not found", the service file was never created.

3. **Check Script 7 logs:**
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u lightwalletd -n 100
   ```

4. **Re-run Script 7 manually:**
   ```bash
   sudo bash ./zecnode-lightwalletd-build.sh
   ```
   
   This will show you exactly where it's failing.
